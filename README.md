## Project Overview

"EvolutionaryAlgorithm-TSP-Visualizer" is a visualization tool that utilizes genetic algorithms to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). This project aims to help users understand the complexity of the TSP and visually demonstrate how evolutionary algorithms operate.

## Key Features

Genetic Algorithm Implementation: Employs a genetic algorithm to explore optimal routes for solving the TSP.
Visualization: Provides real-time visualization of the algorithm's progress, making it easy to understand the changes in routes across generations.
User Interface: Features an intuitive UI that allows users to adjust the number of cities and set algorithm parameters.
Result Analysis: Displays the optimal route and corresponding distance information, enabling performance evaluation of the algorithm.

## Tech Stack

Programming Language: Modern c++

Libraries: SFML
